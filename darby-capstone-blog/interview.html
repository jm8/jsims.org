<h4 id="1-how-did-you-get-started-coding">1. How did you get started coding?</h4>

<p>I got started coding when I was in 5th or 6th grade and got bored sitting in
front of the computer.</p>

<h4 id="2-whats-the-best-part-about-coding">2. What’s the best part about coding?</h4>

<p>In the technological age, the ability to understand and manipulate technology
is essential.</p>

<h4 id="3-whats-the-worst-part-about-coding">3. What’s the worst part about coding?</h4>

<p>Using the computer all day can be bad for your eyesight.</p>

<h4 id="4-how-do-you-stay-motivated-when-working-on-programming-projects">4. How do you stay motivated when working on programming projects?</h4>

<p>Usually, the goal of the project is enough motivation. However,
distractions must be avoided.</p>

<h4 id="5-do-you-think-that-computer-programming-is-a-good-career-choice">5. Do you think that computer programming is a good career choice?</h4>

<p>Yes. It’s an element of many fields and can apply to many areas of interest.
Programming is at the heart of computer graphics and animation, industrial
automation, electronic commerce, and modern communications, to name a few.</p>

<h4 id="6-when-you-program-is-it-really-tiring-so-its-hard-to-do-other-things-in-life">6. When you program, is it really tiring so it’s hard to do other things in life?</h4>

<p>No. Depending on the intensity of the project, it can be mentally tiring, but
the same is true of any scientific or engineering pursuit.</p>

<h4 id="7-how-much-planning-do-you-do-vs-just-jumping-in">7. How much planning do you do vs just jumping in?</h4>

<p>I rarely plan anything on paper, but depending on the complexity of the
feature/project, it can be necessary to think ahead. On complex features or
components, I might go through several iterations, and I usually try to make
the code work first before making it “good”.</p>

<h4 id="8-what-languages-do-you-prefer">8. What languages do you prefer?</h4>

<p>I prefer english mostly. I know a little bit of french but I don’t prefer it.</p>

<h4 id="9-do-you-like-the-web-or-think-it-is-a-mistake">9. Do you like the web or think it is a mistake?</h4>

<p>Given its original purpose of sharing scientific research, I would say it has
been a massive success. I can access many areas of science that I wouldn’t be
introduced to otherwise. On the other hand, Internet video, podcasts, and other
forms of web-enabled entertainment have probably been a net negative.</p>

<h4 id="10-should-i-go-to-computer-science-college">10. Should I go to computer science college?</h4>

<p>College is an effective (though not always cost-effective) way to learn
computer science and computer programming. I tried to minimize costs by going
to a state school that wouldn’t cost as much, and doing internships throughout
my college career. As I mentioned, computer programming is a technique applied
to a variety of fields, and college is a great way to be introduced to some of
those fields. Different colleges and locations will provide you access to
different fields.</p>
