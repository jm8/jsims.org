<p>This project was a great experience. This was a meaningful experience because I was able to create something from start to finished that I wanted to make. Now that I have finished my project, I feel like I am better at working on things and never giving up. There were times when it was hard and caused frustration, when things were not working, but I got through them. I have developed determination to do things and I know I have tried to make my project the best that I can. I developed new knowledege and skills with regards to commputer programming. I now have better skills in Typescript and React. Also, I have learned more about async programming. If I started over, there would be some technical changes I would make, such as setting up “eslint” from the start. Also, I would have planned more because there were some instances where I had to change a lot of code because of a decision I made later on in the process. However, I think that I would have ended up with a similar end result, and I think my experience was very good.</p>
